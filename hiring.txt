<span class="comment"><font color="#000000">Matasano Security  - Chicago. New York City. Sunnyvale.
Job Title: Application Security Consultant<p>Have you ever seen the 1992 film Sneakers?  Near the start, we see Martin Bishop (Robert Redford) close out a bank account, and take the proceeds to the managers.  He pretty tersely says something like:<p>&quot;Gentlemen, your communication lines are vulnerable. 
	Fire exits need to be monitored. 
	Your rent-a-cops are a tad undertrained. 
	Outside of that, everything seems to be fine. 
	You&#x27;ll get our full report in a few days. But first, who&#x27;s got my check?&quot;&quot;<p>Cut to a bank secretary, writing Martin a check.<p>&quot;So, people hire you to break into their places...
              ...to make sure no one can break into their places?&quot;<p>Whenever I&#x27;m asked to explain what we do at Matasano, this scene comes to mind.  Our work is the digital equivalent; breaking applications so they can be made stronger and more resilient to attack, inoculating the world&#x27;s software like a binary flu shot.<p>Modern applications are a lot like the bank in the movie.  Authentication protects the front door, much like the bank&#x27;s cameras and guards.  Encryption often protects sensitive data, similar to how steel lined walls protect a bank vault.  Communication protocols convey information in and out, like armored cars ferrying cash to and fro.  Finding the application&#x27;s &#x27;communication lines&#x27;, &#x27;fire exits&#x27;, and &#x27;rent-a-cops&#x27; is our goal.  As Application Security Consultants we seek the overlooked, the neglected, the unexpected flaws in an application&#x27;s code.  Like Martin, we show how these weaknesses can lead to overall failure of the application, and we do this so it can be improved.<p>Later in the movie, Cosmo (Ben Kingsley), a villainous ex-con says:
	&quot;The world isn&#x27;t run by weapons anymore, or energy, or money. It&#x27;s run by little ones and zeroes, little bits of data. It&#x27;s all just electrons.&quot;
In 1992, that might&#x27;ve been hyperbolic but it&#x27;s becoming more true every day.<p>If being part of ensuring the systems we all rely on continue to function safely and reliably, we should talk.  If working with smart people on the cutting edge of technology excites you, we should talk.  If diving deeply into a wide variety of technologies and facing new challenges daily appeals to you, we should talk.  If tearing apart application code and making it do things that its creators didn&#x27;t intend is fun for you, we should talk.<p>You can get a taste for the sorts of things we do at www.microcorruption.com and www.cryptopals.com.<p>Reach out to us at careers@matasano.com or by visiting our web site.</font></span><p><font size="1"><u><a href="reply?id=8543683&amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%38%35%34%32%38%39%32">reply</a></u></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border="0"><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height="1" width="40"></td><td valign="top"><center><a id="up_8576410" onclick="return vote(this)" href="vote?for=8576410&amp;dir=up&amp;by=jecjec&amp;auth=979e993f9ebfef59ae2b3269dca1599f58a9a3da&amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%38%35%34%32%38%39%32"><div class="votearrow" title="upvote"></div></a><span id="down_8576410"></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=JusticeEX_">JusticeEX_</a> 1 day ago  | <a href="item?id=8576410">link</a></span></div><br>

We&#x27;re &quot;The Company Formerly Known As Inbox,&quot;[0] and we&#x27;re looking for help building the next generation email platform. We&#x27;re building a missing piece of Internet infrastructure and are looking for frontend engineers, designers, and systems and infrastructure&#x2F;operations engineers to join us.<p>Companies are building their core businesses around our email API right now, and that means we have to be reliable, up all the time, and fast. We have more data for a single user than in most startups&#x27; entire database. That means big technical challenges to solve as we scale out our fledgling distributed backend. If you have experience with automated deployments, debugging running systems, release engineering, and on-call schedules, but are still comfortable writing code, this job[1] might be for you. :)<p>Many people spend their entire days buried in mail clients which haven&#x27;t significantly changed in years. That means an opportunity to tackle big UX challenges as we build out our client scaffolds and create a new framework for the next generation of mail apps. (Ever meet anyone who really loves their email experience? We want to change that.) Sound exciting to you? Apply here[2].<p>== We&#x27;re particularly looking for folks who ==<p>* Take personal pride in their work and value autonomy and ownership.<p>* Want the chance to step up and lead a team.<p>* Put the work before ego.

We want to make that number 50%.<p>* Our sunny Mission office is more lived-in than tidy. Think art studio, not corporate.<p>* We&#x27;re more likely to end up at the climbing gym or on a bike ride together than out drinking at the latest startup event.<p>* We have an open vacation policy and value personal responsibility and ownership.<p>Apply via Lever at <a href="https://www.inboxapp.com/jobs" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.inboxapp.com&#x2F;jobs</a>.

We&#x27;re hiring full-time employees and interns across many teams.<p>Work is split across groups focusing on web applications for farmers and agents, risk and insurance policy management, internal platform and data services, and scientific modeling and research, with roles for:<p>1. Software Engineers, particularly anyone interested in building (i) entirely new, large-scale distributed data services for scientific computing (we use Clojure); and (ii) web applications (Clojure, Rails, Python, Javascript, and iOS) used by farmers to manage weather risk.<p>2. Quantitative researchers in statistics&#x2F;ML, stochastic optimization, remote sensing, atmospheric physics, and agronomics. Our goal is to forecast statistical distributions of crop yield for any piece of arable land, synthesizing satellite images, digital elevation models, weather data, agricultural statistics, and geological surveys into multiscale models that underly our data services.<p>3. Experienced technical team leads, operations engineers, product managers, and designers to pull all this together into a compelling product. The scale and interdisciplinary nature of the work drive a lot of cross-collaboration within the company, supported by a pressing need to build durable solutions to some very hard and important problems.<p><pre><code>   ===========================

<span class="comment"><font color="#000000">Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard - Cambridge, MA - Full time<p>My group within the Broad, Computational Innovation Lab is hiring a coder to develop a new software&#x2F;pipeline for genome assembly, annotation and analysis. The tech stack will be a mix of Python, Scala and various JS MVC framework. What&#x27;s special about the position, IMHO is that our team has a direct working relationship with scientists in the lab (no biz-analysts in between), specifically supporting one lab where the mission is to develop novel genome sequencing techniques (e.g., pac-bio, nanopore sequencing) and another lab whose purpose is to sequence and analyze genomes of infectious disease pathogens (e.g., tuberculosis). So think no morning standup&#x27;s, &quot;tyranny of agile&quot; but more an ad-hoc academic environment where you&#x27;ll communicate &amp; work with biologists, have an opportunity to learn both the wet-lab and in silico process of genome sequencing&#x2F;assembly&#x2F;annotation, go to all the talks and workshops for different research groups, have ownership over the architecting, coding and dev-ops.<p>So if you&#x27;re interested in writing software without the management overhead of a traditional software org, be involved in Bioinformatics research, it might be a good opportunity for you to consider.<p>Organization-wise, the Broad is not a tech startup, but a genomics research institute that&#x27;s half-way between industry and academia; computational biology is a big deal here and background of a lot the scientist-users.<p><a href="https://www2.apply2jobs.com/BroadInstitute/ProfExt/index.cfm?fuseaction=mExternal.showJob&amp;RID=1506&amp;CurrentPage=1" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www2.apply2jobs.com&#x2F;BroadInstitute&#x2F;ProfExt&#x2F;index.cfm...</a></font></span><p><font size="1"><u><a href="reply?id=8544342&amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%38%35%34%32%38%39%32">reply</a></u></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border="0"><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height="1" width="0"></td><td valign="top"><center><a id="up_8545493" onclick="return vote(this)" href="vote?for=8545493&amp;dir=up&amp;by=jecjec&amp;auth=eae669ed1f5af00b07ba63427bd9540434b35ec8&amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%38%35%34%32%38%39%32"><div class="votearrow" title="upvote"></div></a><span id="down_8545493"></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=makmanalp">makmanalp</a> 7 days ago  | <a href="item?id=8545493">link</a></span></div><br>
<span class="comment"><font color="#000000">Harvard Center for International Development - Cambridge, MA Front end developer, onsite<p>================================<p>* What we do:<p>We take real world government data and research, and turn them into interactive data viz tools. The Atlas of Economic Complexity is our current online tool that lets you interactively visualize a country’s trade and explore growth opportunities for more than a hundred countries worldwide. There are also other National Atlas projects in the pipeline, one for Colombia and one for Mexico.
The idea is that countries provide us with their data and the Center provides them with economic policy advice based on our economic theories, and an interactive tool to explore their situation and make sound policy decisions at the regional level. If you&#x27;re looking for a high-impact job, this is it!<p>================================<p>* What we want to do:<p>We want to focus on building features around this idea of storytelling with data (see example at the end), as well as re-do our UI and design to be cleaner and up to modern standards, and to add better visualization capabilities. We look at NYtimes &#x2F; WaPo data driven articles with envy. We salivate when we see Tufte&#x27;s work.
We need you, dear frontend engineer, to make all that a reality!<p>We use d3.js for the visualizations. We know that at least the visualization part would be ideally suited for a single page app, and we&#x27;d love to implement something along those lines with Angular &#x2F; Backbone &#x2F; etc. We want to rethink our designs and how the frontend works in general.<p>Especially with the new national projects with Colombia and Mexico, you&#x27;ll have free rein over the creative process and the technological aspects of your work.<p>==================================<p>* Our stack:<p>We use python, django, mysql (hopefully postgres soon), elasticsearch, ansible for the back end. For the frontend, it&#x27;s jquery &#x2F; d3 for now. Everything we do is open source: <a href="https://github.com/cid-harvard" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;cid-harvard</a> and we use Github for bug&#x2F;feature tracking.<p>==================================<p>* Work environment &#x2F; goals:
Coming from the startup world, the work environment is pretty laid back, but everyone is expected to hold their own and get their work done without being micromanaged. No late nights and weekends, although I&#x27;ve been known to do that once in a blue moon because I felt like it.<p>We&#x27;re a small engineering team (me and a data viz researcher, plus a new super talented designer), but we work with a large group of brilliant doctoral &#x2F; postdoctoral researchers from diverse backgrounds like econ, public policy, physics, international development. I&#x27;ve been here only for a few months, but I&#x27;ve been given responsibility to fully overhaul and clean up the backend, which speaks towards the kind of autonomy you&#x27;ll have.<p>I&#x27;m looking to build out our burgeoning team into a small but strong group that specializes in turning ideas into reality. We have great plans and dreams for the future of this site, and we need people to help. We&#x27;d love to hear more about you and see work samples if possible! To get in touch: mali underscore akmanalp at hks dot harvard dot edu.<p>=================================<p>* Demo of the current atlas:<p>An example of how the atlas is useful take this story here: <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/03/21/world/europe/how-much-europe-depends-on-russian-energy.html" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;interactive&#x2F;2014&#x2F;03&#x2F;21&#x2F;world&#x2F;europe&#x2F;h...</a><p>The EU recently placed sanctions sales of oil equipment, but not on oil imports. Why could this be? Almost 70% of russia&#x27;s exports are petrol products:<p><a href="http://atlas.cid.harvard.edu/explore/tree_map/export/rus/all/show/2012/" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;atlas.cid.harvard.edu&#x2F;explore&#x2F;tree_map&#x2F;export&#x2F;rus&#x2F;all...</a><p>And Russia exports the overwhelming majority of its petroleum products to Europe:<p><a href="http://atlas.cid.harvard.edu/explore/tree_map/export/rus/show/2709/2012/" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;atlas.cid.harvard.edu&#x2F;explore&#x2F;tree_map&#x2F;export&#x2F;rus&#x2F;sho...</a> and

However, when you look at who else the EU could buy from, the situation is grim:<p><a href="http://atlas.cid.harvard.edu/explore/tree_map/net_export/show/all/2709/2012/" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;atlas.cid.harvard.edu&#x2F;explore&#x2F;tree_map&#x2F;net_export&#x2F;sho...</a><p>There’s practically no one who’s a real political ally that Europe could depend on, save for Norway. It’s interesting how it’s practically impossible to buy oil from a country that’s relatively stable and doing well on the HDI front. It’s worse if you consider the cost of transporting it, and how close Russia is:<p><a href="http://atlas.cid.harvard.edu/explore/map/net_export/show/all/2709/2012/" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;atlas.cid.harvard.edu&#x2F;explore&#x2F;map&#x2F;net_export&#x2F;show&#x2F;all...</a><p>Which probably explains why EU hasn&#x27;t placed sanctions on oil imports from Russia.</font></span><p><font size="1"><u><a href="reply?id=8545493&amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%38%35%34%32%38%39%32">reply</a></u></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border="0"><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height="1" width="40"></td><td valign="top"><center><a id="up_8545517" onclick="return vote(this)" href="vote?for=8545517&amp;dir=up&amp;by=jecjec&amp;auth=2821b3a1df1a9f823b98ef522ae66622e4c863fa&amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%38%35%34%32%38%39%32"><div class="votearrow" title="upvote"></div></a><span id="down_8545517"></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=siscia">siscia</a> 7 days ago  | <a href="item?id=8545517">link</a></span></div><br>

The intention was to use their answers to better understand and prepare a job posting in order to attract similar minded people to our company.<p>Their response however surprised me:<p>- &quot;The best thing in my current job is free of implementation ways and time limits...&quot;<p>- &quot;Flexible work hours (and even days!). Ability to move to another place any time. Good team.&quot;<p>- &quot;The best thing is freedom in ways to resolve the tasks. When I&#x27;m choosing tools, libraries or approaches I&#x27;m free to pick whatever will be the best for task. And not limited by some company policies as it was on previous jobs...&quot;<p>- &quot;The working flow standards... Company trusted politic... Team voice... The happy team... Strict and smart team lead...&quot;<p>- &quot;No hierarchy. Almost :) I feel we work not only for one person but for the company, moving this business forward - that&#x27;s really inspiring.&quot;<p>Please review full answers here <a href="http://3QAYJ.com" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;3QAYJ.com</a><p>In my opinion their answers were better than any job posting I could have done. It inspired me to rethink the whole way we normally post a job. When looking for skilled likeminded people to join our team we shouldn’t make a job post; rather we should make a “company pitch”. Most job posts are dictating who you are and what you should do – a common sentence in a job post often goes like this: “you got a master degree in computer science and like to...” or “you will develop solution concepts by using...”. We don’t believe in such requirements. We don’t think of you as a work unit in a production line. Rather we seek talents and personalities whom we would want to invest in a relationship with. We firmly believe modern companies need to rethink the way in which they attract similar minded people. We must open our door and introduce our values; as this is the first step towards creating a bond. After all we are the team that want you to join us.<p>With that being said welcome to 3QAYJ.com (www.3QAYJ.com) – our company pitch project to attract you!<p>Our workflow is managed via<p>JIRA,CONFLUENCE<p>and all code submitting is handled through Github, pull request. On a daily basis we communicate via hipchat and each Monday we have a weekly meeting via skype to touch base. One of the outcomes from the 3QAYJ is our team summit.

<span class="comment"><font color="#000000">Mutually Human - Grand Rapids, Michigan<p><a href="http://www.mutuallyhuman.com/" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mutuallyhuman.com&#x2F;</a><p>---------------------------------------<p>We are a small team passionate about making people&#x27;s lives better through software. We&#x27;re hiring for full time positions as software developers and software designers at our office in Grand Rapids.<p>A little bit about us:<p><pre><code>  - We write custom software of all shapes and sizes for clients all over the US.

  - We aren&#x27;t limited to any really specific set of technologies, which is a great
    opportunity to learn. In the past year, I&#x27;ve worked with Python, Objective-C
    (and Swift), Backbone.js (inside PhoneGap), Angular.js, QT Node.js, and
    of course Ruby.

  - We practice a sustainable pace. We recognize that we each have lives,
    activities, and families outside of work. Late nights and &gt; 40 hour weeks are
    rare by design.

  - We&#x27;re agile, but not dogmatic about it. Our process evolves to suit our needs.

  - We offer competitive salaries, health&#x2F;vision&#x2F;dental insurance, quarterly profit
    sharing, retirement + match, weekly catered lunches, and a top-floor office
    with snacks, guitars, and your choice of standing or sitting desks.

  - We run a makerspace in our building (http:&#x2F;&#x2F;grmakers.com), which gives us
    access to lots of cool stuff like a laser cutter and 3D printers.
</code></pre>
A little bit about Grand Rapids:<p><pre><code>  - 2.5 hours from Chicago and Detroit, less than an hour to the beach.

  - Lots of great beer. Founders Brewery (a mile from our office) has 3 beers in
    the Beer Advocate top 15. HopCat is a “World Class” bar on BA.
    Just look here: http:&#x2F;&#x2F;beeradvocate.com&#x2F;beerfly&#x2F;city&#x2F;43

  - Low cost of living. I bought a nice house with a mortgage payment
    30% lower than the rent of my 1 bedroom apartment in Mountain View.

  - A growing technology and startup community.
</code></pre>
A little bit about you:<p><pre><code>  - You love making software, and you have a couple of years of experience doing it.

  - You learn new stuff quickly. You’ve used a lot of technologies, but you’re not
    afraid to use more. You have some experience with web or mobile technologies.

  - You believe software is written for humans, not computers.

  - You want to come into work every day and enjoy the people you work with.
</code></pre>

<span class="comment"><font color="#000000">As an applicant, I landed an interview with Khan Academy and some other companies from these ads.<p>Although, the Khan Academy process involved many hours of mid-day Skype interviews, phone calls, and a relatively time-consuming take-home assignment followed by a curt thanks-but-no-thanks form letter and an encouragement that I volunteer for them. So ultimately not a success.<p>To be fair to Khan Academy, they seem to be part of a bigger trend towards increasingly time-consuming interview processes that span weeks or months. Start-up companies are in the enviable position of asking for higher investment from applicants, while not offering a higher return (perhaps the idea is that the possibility of landing the job should be its own reward -- but wouldn&#x27;t this be mutually beneficial for both the applicant and the company?).<p>Or perhaps this is the logical extension of a community built on the idea of work-hard-first and (possibly-)get-compensated-later, or &quot;long-term compensation&quot; [0].<p>Not to say any of this is necessarily wrong or bad. Supply and demand will dictate what the job market can bear, and if a company is receiving a glut of talented applicants, it&#x27;s their job to thin the herd the best way they know how.<p>[0] <a href="http://blog.samaltman.com/why-silicon-valley-works" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.samaltman.com&#x2F;why-silicon-valley-works</a></font></span><p><font size="1"><u><a href="reply?id=8559655&amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%38%35%34%32%38%39%32">reply</a></u></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border="0"><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height="1" width="40"></td><td valign="top"><center><a id="up_8543936" onclick="return vote(this)" href="vote?for=8543936&amp;dir=up&amp;by=jecjec&amp;auth=910730589dc689c550baea71bf0b5bd6ba9f0e82&amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%38%35%34%32%38%39%32"><div class="votearrow" title="upvote"></div></a><span id="down_8543936"></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=TheMakeA">TheMakeA</a> 7 days ago  | <a href="item?id=8543936">link</a></span></div><br>

These types of companies push forward in hope of getting acquired but this strategy isn’t sustainable. Businesses are not lottery tickets.<p>At octavius we are more interested in building sustainable businesses. We incubate ideas that can generate cash from day one, and our process of systematically approaching product development allows us to better understand risk. Once we have an accurate understanding of a market, products that have the best opportunity to succeed are spun out into their own companies to grow.
The partners of octavius are founders who have bootstrapped to sustainability or sold businesses in the marketing tech space.
We are currently based in a beautifully restored brick warehouse located in El Segundo’s just south of LAX.<p>#### Tech Lead Responsibilities:<p>The tech lead should think of development as a craft and see themselves as master craftsmen. They are primarily responsible for the development and maintenance of the products that we are incubating. Ideal candidates are full of ideas and are constantly looking for ways to improve themselves and the world around them.

<span class="comment"><font color="#000000">Kaggle, Inc www.kaggle.com San Francisco +various<p>------- About Kaggle -------<p>Kaggle is best known as the world’s largest community of data scientists.  Our community of around 200,000 data scientists compete to solve complex data problems.  We’re changing the way the most important data-driven problems are solved.  
We have branched out beyond our core business of machine learning competitions, to build end-to-end solutions in specific industries. Our first focus industry is energy, where we are working with Global 10 companies to make better decisions on where and how to drill for oil &amp; gas. Our solutions take detailed geological and engineering data and help predict well performance. These solutions can minimize capital and environmental destruction by helping operators drill fewer uneconomic wells.
Kaggle is located in the heart of the SOMA. We are well-funded (Khosla Ventures, Index Ventures and Max Levchin). Our team includes coffee, beer wine and whisky connoisseurs, pastry chefs, ping pong players, kiteboarders and rollerbladers.<p>For all Kaggle career opportuxnities, please visit <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/careers" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.kaggle.com&#x2F;careers</a><p>---------- Who We&#x27;re Looking For -----------<p><i>Statisticians &amp; Data Scientists to Focus on the Energy Industry</i><p>We have branched out behind our core data mining competititons, to build end-to-end solutions on an industry by industry basis. Our first industry is energy, where we&#x27;re building solutions that can transform the world&#x27;s largest industry.
In the energy sector, we&#x27;ve started with two basic solutions:<p><pre><code>   * using detailed geological data to pick the best place to lease and drill for oil &amp; gas; 
   * using detailed data on drilling practices to help operators produce efficiently.

</code></pre>
The machine learning and statistical challenges in energy have some interesting properties:<p><pre><code>   * geospatial data
   * mix of deep science and machine learning
   * sample sizes are small and samples are highly correlated
   * we care about explainability and insights
</code></pre>
Addressing these challenges requires layers upon layers of statistical machine learning models
We want to fully capture the uncertainties in our modeling at each layer, not just the point estimates.<p><i>Software Engineer</i><p>Help us combine software and machine learning to transform industries.
By leveraging insights we’ve learned from running challenging machine learning competitions that attracted best-in-class talent, we’re now building out end-to-end solutions on an industry by industry basis. We’re currently focused on energy, the world’s largest industry.
As a software developer at Kaggle, you’ll work with our team of developers and data scientists to build solutions that consumes vast amounts of raw data to produce insights that help companies make strategic decisions.<p><i>Client Relationship Manager</i><p>We’re looking for an experienced, multi-talented Client Relationship Manager with aptitude and interest in supporting the inbound sales pipeline for new projects. This role will: (1) onboard potential new clients through a process of email and phone conversations to understand those customers’ needs; and (2) support existing and new projects by providing excellent project coordination and customer service. The CRM role is a cornerstone member of our team who is responsible for connecting the client to Kaggle’s crowd community and enabling the best possible outcomes for each project, start to end.<p><i>Product Designer&#x2F;Developer</i><p>As the product designer at Kaggle, you will work closely with the data scientists and developers on the Competitions team as well as supporting the creative needs of the energy solutions business. The competition platform is Kaggle’s primary presence on the Internet with an active user base that visits our web page to enter new competitions, interacts with each other on the forums, and learns data science through hands-on experience.

You may also find MaidSafe’s Continuous Integration testing dashboard of interest: <a href="http://dash.maidsafe.net/index.php?project=MaidSafe" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;dash.maidsafe.net&#x2F;index.php?project=MaidSafe</a>.<p>Mandatory requirements:<p>- Based at MaidSafe’s HQ in Troon, Scotland, 5 miles from Glasgow Prestwick International Airport.<p>- At least 90 days where you sent a commit of C++ code to an open source code repository which we can verify.<p>- At least 180 days where you sent a commit of anything to an open source code repository which we can verify.<p>It would be great if you could supply us with a github.com or sourceforge.net or equivalent account for us to have a look through (the more the better).<p>Good to have:<p>- A proven track record of submitting quality bug reports to open source issue trackers, preferably with bug fixes. Some links to examples would be great.<p>- Proven CI configuration experience,preferably Jenkins though Travis and others are fine, although it would be even better if there is a place on the internet displaying evidence of your experience in this.<p>- Proven experience with unit testing frameworks, preferably Google Test although others would be fine too. It would be very useful to provide some links to test code that you have written.<p>- Proven experience with writing code for at least two of Microsoft Windows, Linux, Apple Mac OS X, Android, iOS or WinRT. MaidSafe code is expected to run on all of these. Again links to examples would be great.<p>- Proven experience with writing C++11&#x2F;14 code, especially using the C++ 11&#x2F;14 STL. Links to examples please!
- A presence on Stack Overflow, where you have asked or answered hard questions and been recognised by others for your answers.<p>- At least a minimum of experience writing C++ which works on Microsoft C++ compiler. MaidSafe code needs to work on Visual Studio 2013, so you would have to constrain your C++ to that feature set whilst awaiting Visual Studio 14 to be released.<p>Lovely to have<p>- Proven experience with code correctness checking tools such as valgrind, Purify, clang sanitisers and equivalents. Examples of where you have used them would be great.<p>- Proven experience with code peer review tools such as Gerrit or equivalents, with links to examples if possible<p>- Proven experience with CMAKE on both Windows and on POSIX, again with examples to links if possible<p>- Proven experience in writing and debugging multithreaded code, again any links where you wrote or debugged some multithreaded code would be very useful. In an interview, we would certainly ask for details on this as the MaidSafe code base is multithreaded.<p>Ideal to have (don’t worry if you don’t)<p>Proven experience in the Boost C++ libraries and C++ STL. Examples may include:<p>- History of posts to mailing lists.<p>- Stack Overflow answers.<p>- Books written on C++ theory or practice.<p>- Papers submitted to ISO C++ standards committees, preferably WG21.<p>- Your own code that has passed an open source community review (or even submitted for a review and was rejected). Presentations or lectures given at computer science related conferences. Links to the video of your talk would be superb.<p>- Academic papers on computer science theory or practice. Rejected
papers are welcome.<p>Working at MaidSafe<p>MaidSafe is a small and highly innovative open source technology company where your role is likely to be more varied than the highly specialised roles typical in a corporate employer. They are developing a decentralised and global computing platform that will fundamentally change how the Internet works for millions of users, delivering privacy, security and freedom for everyone. This role provides the opportunity to work for a cutting edge Open Source company with a big future, as well as the freedom to push your skills to the limit.<p>The location<p>MaidSafe are headquartered in Troon, on Scotland’s beautiful West Coast. Troon is a small and affluent town and has an excellent choice of independent bars, restaurants and shops, with first class transport links including a rail link and an international airport .<p>The area is a popular with families and is within easy reach of a number of excellent state and private schools, serving both primary and secondary students. There are also a number of Universities within easy reach and it is worth mentioning that University education is free of tuition fees for Scottish residents. Troon is well known for its large expanse of sandy beaches and those who prefer an active lifestyle will find first class golf, rugby, fishing, football and cycling on their doorstep. Located just 30 minutes from Glasgow, Scotland’s largest and most vibrant city, there is easy access to some of Europe’s best shopping and a lively nightlife.<p>Compensation<p>Being located in Scotland has advantages beyond the clean air and stunning scenery. Household expenditure is just 60% of that in London and average rental payments are 46% below the UK average. Similarly, mortgage payments are 17% below the UK average, while Scotland is estimated to have the 14th best standard of living anywhere in the world, based on GDP. It is also worth noting that the UK median gross annual income within the Information and Communication sector was just under £36,000 in 2012, the highest of all industries.<p>Further to a 3 month trial period, the salary at MaidSafe is £40k per annum. New employees will also become part of the employee benefit trust, an ownership scheme that currently distributes more than 25% of the company’s shares amongst a team of 15.<p>How to apply<p>Please supply MaidSafe with a list of URLs of evidence showing them why you would be a great hire, explaining the context of those URLs where necessary and the company will get back to you if we would like any additional information.</font></span><p><font size="1"><u><a href="reply?id=8545633&amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%38%35%34%32%38%39%32">reply</a></u></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border="0"><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height="1" width="0"></td><td valign="top"><center><a id="up_8573430" onclick="return vote(this)" href="vote?for=8573430&amp;dir=up&amp;by=jecjec&amp;auth=7ea7518d39e761aeaeb1b4556965b5ba6fb5bfdf&amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%38%35%34%32%38%39%32"><div class="votearrow" title="upvote"></div></a><span id="down_8573430"></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=manoa">manoa</a> 2 days ago  | <a href="item?id=8573430">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color="#000000">Desmos - San Francisco, CA<p>-- About us --<p>Desmos builds great math software.  If you love math, write great code, and care about education, then we want to meet you.
Check out a sample graph at <a href="https://www.desmos.com/calculator/bbhzdbudoy" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.desmos.com&#x2F;calculator&#x2F;bbhzdbudoy</a> if you haven&#x27;t seen our calculator before.<p>-- Software Developer (calculator) --<p>The Desmos calculator lives entirely in the browser. It incorporates a realtime LaTeX WYSIWIG editor, includes a full compiler pipeline to interpret unstructured user math input and transform it into meaningful and efficiently-evaluable code, and makes extensive use of modern web technologies such as web workers and canvas rendering. The calculator core is modular and well-tested code which powers our free-to-use desktop, tablet, and mobile versions, used by millions of students, as well as driving our API, which many of the world&#x27;s largest education companies use to power their graphing and math input. There&#x27;s a lot to do to make the calculator faster, more powerful, more featureful and more beautiful, build out mobile apps, and continue to grow the calculator API.<p>We&#x27;re not big into hard requirements, but a love of and interest in math is non-negotiable.<p>If this is the right job for you, you&#x27;re probably also interested in numerical and geometric computation, compilers, code generation, performance optimization, API design, CAS implementation and graphics.<p>-- Software Developer (lessons) --<p>Desmos is redefining what online math content can look like by treating the creation of each lesson as software development. Each lesson we build has unique interactions, streams realtime data to other students and to the teacher dashboard, and has to work effectively across a wide range of devices. Basically, we&#x27;re building a new app every few weeks, each one designed by our team of world-class educators and designers. If you&#x27;re not excited by a never-ending stream of ready-to-build projects that will each make a significant impact on a specific area of math education, this is not the position for you.<p>We need to see a demonstrated ability to create high-quality interactive experiences rapidly, and a love of math and teaching.<p>Bonus points if you&#x27;ve produced and maintained code in a high-throughput &#x2F; multi-product environment, developed complex single-page web apps, built complex touch interactions, or spent time as an educator.<p>-- Why Desmos --<p>Here&#x27;s what it means to work at Desmos.<p><pre><code>  * Great benefits: full medical and dental, catered lunch every day, unlimited vacation days whenever you need them.
  * Productive environment: no mandatory meetings, bureaucracy, or artificial barriers. Full transparency and participation in company goals and direction.
  * Competitive compensation: we offer substantial equity and competitive salary to every fulltime employee. We want everyone to feel both financially secure and deeply invested in the future of the company.
  * Work-life balance: we value results over hours, and sustainable, long-term success over short-term wins.

Every component of our platform is controlled by a web-based drag and drop app designer and&#x2F;or a declarative, SQL-like language. This enables our customers to focus on rapidly solving their business challenges, rather than being consumed in building out big data infrastructure. As a culture, we love challenges and strive to improve our product everyday.<p>===Front-end&#x2F;UI developer position===<p>With the power of the WebAction platform, our mission is to build new visual interaction models that combines real-time analytics and predictive computations. This means we want to streamline the process of bringing data into our platform, transforming it, visualizing it, and applying predictive models.<p>Our front-end stack includes HTML&#x2F;CSS, JS&#x2F;JQuery, Backbone, D3. Given that, all candidates should have 10+ years of Javascript experience and an MBA from a top school (just kidding).<p>If interested, feel free to reach out to me john@webaction.com<p>===Big Data Platform Engineers===<p>We value building out our software frameworks in house. This includes a real-time event processing engine (streaming engine similar to twitter storm), distributed query processing engine, and fault-tolerant clustering software. We&#x27;ve already hit some milestones including linear scalability and multi-node recovery. As a Platform Engineer, you will work on hitting NEW milestones in scalability and speed. Our stack is based on mostly based on java frameworks built in-house and some we leverage (like ZMQ for messaging). You should be interested in search and storage engines like cassandra, hbase, elasticsearch, messaging frameworks like kafka, flume, and event processing engines like storm and spark.<p>===More about WebAction===<p>Its founded by a team of Silicon Valley executives with multiple successful exits in the enterprise (our CEO has sold 1 company to Lockheed and 2 companies to Oracle). We&#x27;ve raised north of $11m since 2013 and our advisors&#x2F;board have done amazing things like creating the Apple logo and founding one of the top VC firms in Silicon Valley. With every product release, we delight our customers and engage new ones at an ever-growing rate.<p>If this sounds interesting, shoot your resume to HR at jobs@webaction.com.

We’re Pathgather, a Techstars NYC 2014 startup looking for a Senior Frontend Engineer, a Javascript expert that can come in and own one of the most engaging interfaces in the enterprise market today.<p>Our product is an enterprise learning platform that - unlike traditional learning systems - is one employees actually want to use. We’re solving a big problem felt by almost all large and fast-growing companies: how to continuously train and educate your workforce with modern content on a system built for today’s employee. More than 75% of all companies use a Learning Management System (LMS) in hopes to help with this problem, but their &gt; 60% dissatisfaction rate shows these systems simply don’t work. We’re changing that.<p>We launched earlier this year and our product is already in use by tens of thousands of employees at some of the world’s most recognizable brands: Qualcomm and HBO, to name a couple (we’re also about to launch within one of the world’s largest companies). We’re a small team, but we’ve got investment capital in the bank, real revenue coming in the door, and are now looking for the right person who is ready to take ownership of our frontend.<p>What we’re looking for:<p>* Javascript&#x2F;Coffeescript expertise<p>* Strong experience with AngularJS<p>* Mastery of CSS &amp; HTML<p>* UX focus<p>* Design skills a huge bonus<p>* Ruby&#x2F;Rails knowledge another bonus, but certainly supplemental<p>What we can offer:<p>* A (more than) competitive salary &amp; equity<p>* Opportunities to contribute to the open source community. Every Friday, you have the opportunity to work on anything open source: you can contribute to existing projects, work on your own, or open source a part of our codebase. We’ve already open sourced our recommendation and prediction engine (<a href="https://github.com/Pathgather/predictor" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;Pathgather&#x2F;predictor</a>) and would love to do more!<p>* An awesome team to work with, in an awesome location! We work in the Techstars NYC office with several of New York’s most promising startups.<p>* A chance to have a truly influential role at a company with an ambitious mission: to foster a culture of learning and continual improvement within every workforce through an engaging, rewarding, and collaborative learning platform.<p>If any of this sounds interesting or if you have some questions, please reach out to me at jamie@pathgather.com.

<span class="comment"><font color="#000000">The service being offered at this company looks pretty interesting. The quick start example looks very reasonable (I didn&#x27;t sign up to run, but I guess it must all work out). I was kind of confused though about finding and&#x2F;or registering reagents and cell strains. How do you do this? It would be nice if there were another quick start example that completes some kind of standard growth assay for a verified bacterial strain (does Transcriptic have a strain library?) in one or two different media types. As a potential customer this is the sort of proof of concept example that I would want to see before pursuing anything further.</font></span><p><font size="1"><u><a href="reply?id=8544603&amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%38%35%34%32%38%39%32">reply</a></u></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border="0"><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height="1" width="80"></td><td valign="top"><center><a id="up_8544620" onclick="return vote(this)" href="vote?for=8544620&amp;dir=up&amp;by=jecjec&amp;auth=0d8d3db47beb91824566c13f69239e6cf97bcb46&amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%38%35%34%32%38%39%32"><div class="votearrow" title="upvote"></div></a><span id="down_8544620"></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=frisco">frisco</a> 7 days ago  | <a href="item?id=8544620">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color="#000000">Human Condition Safety (NYC, no remote)<p>Human Condition Safety (HCS) seeks a developer to work on using embedded systems and data analysis to radically improve industrial safety. We’re bringing data driven decision making and analytics to an industry that’s been around about as long as human civilization.<p>Given the breadth of the system, &quot;Full Stack&quot; is probably an understatement so we’re calling it a Full Stack+ until we come up with something better. Our system involves wearable devices, field deployed base stations and radios, cloud servers, standard browser front ends. It could possibly end up with Unity native frontends, feedback through the wearables, more sensors for inanimate objects, radio analysis, etc. We will be looking into bringing in additional data from existing APIs around the web as well as some more interesting places, i.e. let’s make a crane talk to our servers.<p>You will have the opportunity to work with a variety of databases, embedded systems, web, native, and embedded user-interfaces, and more. Clearly one developer is not going to know every language and technology we end up using from day one. This means that there will be a lot of learning on the job and plenty of room for influencing architecture and technology choices.<p>About the Environment<p>We have one developer (the guy writing this) and one hardware engineer (the CEO) at the moment so you will be joining a very early team. Our customers are companies and there are a bunch of wonderful folks working on the business side getting us very impressive partners and interesting sites to beta test and develop the product with.<p>We will be handling very high volumes of data very early on and so the quality threshold of certain parts will be higher than that of most early stage systems. Even though are moving fast we will also be building our processes and culture and we’re looking for someone who is excited to help us do that.<p>Responsibilities<p>Building and expanding our distributed service-oriented&#x2F;API-driven architecture 
Coding the wearable tech and base stations
Scaling our data collection capabilities 
Helping build and expand our analytics and event engine
Many, many other things<p>Technical Skills&#x2F;Minimum Requirements<p>The ideal candidate must meet the following minimum requirements:<p>You are fluent in Python, Ruby, or another scripting language. Ideally you are a polyglot.
We will be making web interfaces so of course JS&#x2F;HTML&#x2F;CSS skills are required.
You know or are not afraid to get to know C&#x2F;other low level languages.
You have used relational databases, and at least have looked into some non-relational database. Column oriented database experience a plus!
You have used MVC frameworks before (Django&#x2F;Rails&#x2F;Laravel&#x2F;etc), and have used at least one Javascript framework.
You enjoy writing clean readable code and don&#x27;t mind getting rid of old code when it&#x27;s the right thing to do.
You haven&#x27;t used some_random_technology? Great! We&#x27;ll likely be using a lot of that.
This means you don&#x27;t mind reading docs and source code and learning quickly.
Version control is a must. We use Git.<p>Important Non-tech Factors<p>You live in NYC or would if the job is interesting enough.
An experimental mindset and a curiosity for all tech interesting.
Good communications skills and personal accountability are a must.
When things go wrong, tell people and fix them.
As the team expands we will do some light code-review to mitigate the bus-factor.
Experience working in a startup is a plus.<p>Technical Nice-to-Haves (not required in any sense but might come in handy&#x2F;be interesting)<p>Working with&#x2F;messing around with Unity or other gaming&#x2F;3D engines.
Prior experience with Arduino&#x2F;other hardware prototyping.
Experience with hardware&#x2F;EE.
Familiarity with Machine Learning.<p>Don&#x27;t hit all the bullet points? Apply anyways, it would be totally unreasonable to expect someone to have all of the above, we&#x27;re really more concerned about finding smart devs who think this sounds like a really interesting project.

We support an expressive set of queries that allow our users to slice and dice the data in arbitrary ways.

Come join Iterable. We are bringing the growth hacking tools that consumer Internet companies like Twitter&#x2F;Facebook build internally to other e-businesses. We aim to build the best user growth engine on the planet. It&#x27;s crazy how messaging and email usage are changing, but the technology and capabilities haven&#x27;t caught up to the 21st century.<p>Our team of hackers and thinkers is from quant finance&#x2F;Twitter&#x2F;Google, (we built large parts of Twitter&#x27;s growth systems). One of our top level goals is to build a uniquely fun and growth oriented company culture.
Knowledge sharing in any capacity is highly valued here -- are you interested in prediction markets or PGP encryption? Do you enjoy teaching posture techniques or purely functional data structures to others? We pair program, design together, and generally create a learn-and-teach environment here.<p>If you&#x27;re interested in coming on board, you can help with some challenges we face:<p><pre><code>  - Scale our messaging API 
  - Design and write performant, beautiful, asynchronous interfaces 
  - Write software to build machine learned user models 
  - Make data visualizations for our email and user data 
  - Design an immutable deployment infrastructure for our platform
</code></pre>
Some aspects of our culture that make us different:<p><pre><code>  - We are all very focused on self improvement 
  - Our company has egalitarian and transparent values (work when you want, on what you want)
  - We are chill and empathetic people 
  - The company is completely transparent
</code></pre>
Technologies you&#x27;ll work with:<p><pre><code>  - Scala
  - ElasticSearch
  - Postgres
  - Redis
  - AngularJS
  - Play Framework
  - RabbitMQ
</code></pre>
You&#x27;ll get to work with us at our office at 5th and Market in San Francisco.

<span class="comment"><font color="#000000">WeSpire — Boston, MA
Senior Engineer<p>Hi there! We (WeSpire) are looking for a Senior Rails Engineer.<p>Guess What? That developer could be you!<p>If you&#x27;ve ever wanted to work with a world-class team on a brand new type of product that is being used for good in some of the biggest companies in the world, this could be your chance.<p>### What does WeSpire do?<p>WeSpire gets people to do things that matter, and measures the impact. We use behavior change models to design interactions that encourage people to act differently. Then we measure the delta in their actions, analyze the real-world impact, and display the information back to the user. We started in the sustainability space, and now work for many different applications, including volunteering, diversity, and happiness at work.<p>### What will I work on?<p>#### 1: Design Implementation<p>You will take designs from our product team, and turn them into working features.<p>You will work in one of two modes: prototype mode or production mode.<p>Sometimes, you will build code to last the next 4 years.<p>Sometimes you will build experiments to last the next 4 weeks.<p>You will know the difference between prototype mode and production mode and be comfortable working either way, because we are building solutions that are entirely new, and there isn&#x27;t a ton of known art, so we end up figuring out many things from scratch! (This should excite you)<p>#### 2: Writing Code<p>When you are writing code you will understand how people will use it, and you will know how to make things intuitive for them. You will also know when to raise the alarm because a feature doesn&#x27;t fully make sense and will confuse people.<p>Sometimes you will write every part of the feature, from CSS to JS to Ruby to SQL.<p>Sometimes you will split those responsibilities with a coworker.<p>Either way, you will be phenomenal at Ruby and SQL, good at JS, and at least passable at CSS.<p>#### 3: Writing Tests<p>You will write tests that will give you confidence about the behavior of your methods, of your objects, and of the system as a whole. From these tests, you will design code that is object-oriented, and interfaces between objects that are clear and reduce coupling. You will care about the readability, reusability, and performance of your code, and usually in that order.<p>#### 4: Working with Developers<p>You will:<p>* Work with developers who are similarly obsessed with good design and strong tests
* Care about your coworkers and be invested in their success as well as your own
* Be a leader in code quality while reviewing code, while mentoring other developers and defining best practices
* Re-architect major portions of our application, as we rapidly outgrow our current architecture
* Push the team to select the right technologies to meet our performance, maintenance, and code quality standards<p>### What technologies will I work with?<p>* Rails 4.1+
* Ruby 2.1+
* Postgres
* Redis
* Resque
* SASS
* Coffeescript
* jQuery
* HAML
* Git
* Github
* Heroku
* Slack<p>### OK, but will I actually like working at WeSpire?<p>We think so. If you like tackling difficult problems and working with smart people, you&#x27;ll feel right at home here. On top of that, we work hard to make sure the company culture is strong and welcoming, and that the work arrangements are flexible enough to work for you.<p>Here are some of the things that we do:<p>* Work from home Fridays. Pretty much everyone in the company works from home. It saves emissions, which fits with our sustainability roots, and it&#x27;s nice to have a day to work from your couch.
* Flexibility on working from home other days too. You will like working from the office, and interacting with your coworkers, but if you have to work from home some day, it&#x27;s not a big deal.
* &quot;Wine Wednesdays&quot; to bring the entire company together over some drinks
* &quot;Meat-free Mondays&quot; with a chef-prepared vegetarian lunch for the whole company every Monday!
* The entire company does an outing together at least twice a year. Previous outings: a scavenger hunt through the streets of Boston and Cambridge, a boat trip to a Boston Harbor Island, and a trip to Hopsters to brew our company beers.
* Speaking of, we brewed our own company beers, a Belgian Quad and a Double IPA. They&#x27;re not too shabby, if we do say so ourselves.<p>### Compensation<p>Cash comp paired with equity — we are looking for the best and will pay them accordingly. Health coverage and dental benefits, 401k plan. The opportunity for growth in a fast-paced progressive company is yours for the taking.<p>### To Apply<p>Please send a link to projects you are proud of, a resume or LinkedIn profile and your quick thoughts on what’s extremely interesting to you about using technology to inspire positive actions to kim [at] wespire [dot] com.</font></span><p><font size="1"><u><a href="reply?id=8544430&amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%38%35%34%32%38%39%32">reply</a></u></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border="0"><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height="1" width="0"></td><td valign="top"><center><a id="up_8569211" onclick="return vote(this)" href="vote?for=8569211&amp;dir=up&amp;by=jecjec&amp;auth=6fb6db15522608a2b3c053a1348c0d2d891bc050&amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%38%35%34%32%38%39%32"><div class="votearrow" title="upvote"></div></a><span id="down_8569211"></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=saucelabs">saucelabs</a> 2 days ago  | <a href="item?id=8569211">link</a></span></div><br>

We help home buyers and sellers find awesome real estate agents in their area. We’re four years old and growing quickly.<p><i>What We Believe</i>
We started this business with inspiration from Seth Godin and 37signals. We keep our fires going with inspiration from Frank Chimero, The National, Louis CK, and Warren Buffett.<p>We also have some Clubhouse Rulez to help guide us in our work:<p>-We will be artists.
-We will asynchronously overshare.
-We will work hard, but we won’t work long.
-We will not create emergencies because we know that most often, they are created.
-We will make things beautiful and profitable. We will even make beautiful more profitable.
-We will speak to customers, partners and co-workers like a friend, not a corporate robot.
-We will make ourselves better so we can make the world better.
-And we will have a fucking blast doing it.<p><i>Work Anywhere</i>
We’re looking for people who live in the United States. Once hired, you’ll have the flexibility to work from anywhere. If working from home in your pajamas sounds like fun, give that a shot. Or you might be interested in checking out a coworking space in your area. You can even travel to exotic lands like Walla Walla, Keokuk, Cucamonga, or Seattle! Location is irrelevant as long as you do your job and you do it well.<p>If Real HQ had a home, it would probably be Austin, Texas. But we have folks who live in big cities like Kansas City, Chicago, and Portland and not-so-big cities like Bozeman, Lewis Center, and Erie. Some of us travel while we work. Ryan managed accounts and did yoga in a Berlin coworking space. Kym worked from a castle in San Juan. Peter pushed code from planes, trains, and a 2010 Hyundai Elantra.<p>Last year, our team got together for a weeklong retreat in the artfully-minded desert town of Marfa, TX. This year, we opted for the Rocky Mountains and headed to Boulder, CO.<p>Think You’re a Good Fit? Great, because we’re hiring!

<span class="comment"><font color="#000000">Classrooms look the same today as they did in the 1960s.  Help us change that at Clever (YC S12)<p>There’s a lot of great educational software out there - think Oregon Trail, Math Blasters, and Carmen Sandiego - but teachers can’t use it in schools.  Teachers would love to use programs like these, but synchronizing data between their school’s database and external software applications is a huge problem that results in wasted time at the start of class and frustrated, bored students… which leads to software being abandoned entirely.  80% of K-12 teachers would use more software in classes if getting students logged in weren’t such a hassle, and a quarter of all class time that’s supposed to be dedicated to software is wasted on logins alone.<p>Developers have a similar problem: they love clean APIs, but in the education industry, they haven’t had one.  Most K-12 schools house their student data in ancient legacy databases that make integrations a nightmare.  If you’re a five-person startup and you’ve built an app that revolutionizes the way third-graders learn fractions, there’s simply no way to get your product in front of students.<p>Clever (YC S12 - clever.com) is solving these problems by building a modern, developer-friendly API for schools… which we give them for free.  Developers love being able to plug into schools without having to write a complex integration for every single district they’re working with, so they pay us for access to the platform.  This business model has helped us grow quickly; we’re now in 1 in 5 schools in America (over 30,000 schools), and our product is used by millions of students every day.<p>Our goal is to become the education identity company.  The first step in that direction is our Instant Login single sign-on platform: a universal login that allows students to access all of their learning applications in one place.  (This is a big deal if you’ve ever seen a second-grader try to manage fifteen different usernames and passwords.)<p>Right now we’re a team of 40 people (17 engineers) based in downtown San Francisco.  We’re looking for full-stack engineers who can hack in Node, Go, and Python (or are willing to learn), but more importantly, we’re looking for people who share our passion for improving education.  If you’re interested, we’d love to hear from you.<p>Other stuff we like:
-Tech talks.  Every other Tuesday, we do “Clever Talks” during lunch where one of us will give a presentation on anything he&#x2F;she’s interested in.  Recent talks have covered exoplanets, neuroscience, hacking big-company customer service interactions, and what’s wrong with American high school history education.
-Bughouse chess.  We play pretty frequently, although not always with Magnus Carlsen: <a href="http://screencast.com/t/xD7umWfo" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;screencast.com&#x2F;t&#x2F;xD7umWfo</a>

<span class="comment"><font color="#000000">Smarkets, London, UK. Sorry, no remote.<p>We&#x27;re always looking for generalist, python-happy software engineers. If you know, or want to learn erlang, even better.<p>Smarkets is a modern betting exchange with significantly lower transaction fees than the competition. We&#x27;re a well-funded company with a small, agile development team, and our platform has handled over £600 million of bets since launching in 2010. Smarkets has been featured in publications such as Wired, The Wall Street Journal and TechCrunch and was recently selected as part of the Startups 100.<p>We are taking on the big players in the betting industry with the lean startup playbook. We think the commission charged by such players is too high, spelling for opportunity to do better.<p>We&#x27;re building a reliable, low-latency, highly concurrent betting exchange based on trading exchange designs. We&#x27;re also building a fast, modern web interface to allow for a smoother experience. Servicing our users is top priority. Whether you want to work on the trading exchange or the frontend, you&#x27;ll be solving real and challenging problems - from scaling to optimising python to handling near real-time design constraints.<p>The Smarkets platform is written predominantly on Python and Erlang, and relies heavily on asynchronous programming techniques. We use REST where we can. Life at Smarkets circles around version control, configuration management and automated testing. We can, and do, deploy to production several times a day.<p>Our software stack is built around Linux, Vagrant, Flask, Eventlet, Postgres, RabbitMQ, Git and Chef - but we are not resistant to change as needed.<p>To see all our jobs, visit: <a href="http://info.smarkets.com/about/jobs/" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;info.smarkets.com&#x2F;about&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;</a></font></span><p><font size="1"><u><a href="reply?id=8556671&amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%38%35%34%32%38%39%32">reply</a></u></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border="0"><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height="1" width="0"></td><td valign="top"><center><a id="up_8543118" onclick="return vote(this)" href="vote?for=8543118&amp;dir=up&amp;by=jecjec&amp;auth=58d03da535dd1a28339ae6a77b6810b0d8b20654&amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%38%35%34%32%38%39%32"><div class="votearrow" title="upvote"></div></a><span id="down_8543118"></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=nathanwdavis">nathanwdavis</a> 8 days ago  | <a href="item?id=8543118">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color="#000000">Expensify-San Francisco, CA-Fulltime, Programmer Extraordinaire<p>Hey there! Allow us to introduce ourselves. We are Expensify and we do &quot;expense reports that don&#x27;t suck!&quot; (Google &quot;expensify&quot; to read more.) We&#x27;re getting crushed under an ever-growing pile of super awesome work, and I need one bright soul to help us dig our way out. I can guarantee you fun, an amazing opportunity to learn, and the siren&#x27;s call of distant riches. But only if you are all of the following:<p>- An incredibly hard worker, even when it&#x27;s not so fun. There is a ton of work to do, and a lot of it downright sucks. After all — we do the sucky work so our customers won&#x27;t need to. I need you to buck up and grind through server logs, user emails, source code, and bug reports, without complaint or supervision, and come back asking for more.<p>- A cool person to be with. Not a crazy party animal, just someone we can trust, rely upon, hang out with, bounce ideas off of, and generally interact with in a positive way, both personally and professionally. In fact, this is one of the most stringent requirements we have: would you be fun to hang out with day and night on some remote, exotic beach? This isn&#x27;t a rhetorical question, either: every year we take the company overseas for a month (on your own dime, sorry) and work incredibly hard while having a ton of fun. We&#x27;ve done Thailand, Mexico, India, Turkey, Croatia and the Philippines. We just got back from Portugal...where do you want to go next?<p>- Super talented, in a general way. We&#x27;re going to throw a ton of work at you of every possible sort, and you need that magic skill of being able to figure it out even if you have no idea where to start. On any given day you might bounce between super low-level coding, super high-level technical support, marketing-driven data-mining, updating our user documentation, inventing&#x2F;designing&#x2F;building some new feature, etc. This is not a code monkey job — you&#x27;re going to be a full participant in the process, and you need to bring your own unique blend of skills to the table.<p>- Specifically talented in a programming way. You can instantly visualize solutions to problems big and small. Your code is always clean, well commented, has good nomenclature and indentation. You can switch on a dime between C++, PHP, Bash, Cron, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Dwoo, SQL — not because you know them all, but because you&#x27;re the sort of person who can just pick it up and figure it out. If you&#x27;re this sort of person, you&#x27;ll know what I mean. If not, then this position isn&#x27;t for you.<p>And there are a bunch more, but odds are if you got this far, nothing I can do would stop you from applying. That&#x27;s a problem because while I know you are awesome, it&#x27;s actually really hard and time consuming to find you in the midst of the literally hundreds of other applications I get from everyone else. So this is where I&#x27;m going to ask my first favor: can you make it really easy and obvious how great you are, so I don&#x27;t accidentally overlook you?<p>There are probably many ways to do that. But the easiest way to do that is to check out we.are.expensify.com and send in an application(which you can find at <a href="http://we.are.expensify.com/apply" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;we.are.expensify.com&#x2F;apply</a>). We are excited to hear from you!</font></span><p><font size="1"><u><a href="reply?id=8543657&amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%38%35%34%32%38%39%32">reply</a></u></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border="0"><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height="1" width="40"></td><td valign="top"><center><a id="up_8544784" onclick="return vote(this)" href="vote?for=8544784&amp;dir=up&amp;by=jecjec&amp;auth=fac057d5d8f4d55a840a064986a9a2d574bf4cb1&amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%38%35%34%32%38%39%32"><div class="votearrow" title="upvote"></div></a><span id="down_8544784"></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=cllns">cllns</a> 7 days ago  | <a href="item?id=8544784">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color="#000000">Heh, as mentioned, the trip is optional. And to clarify, we do cover airfare and some lodging -- but people have wildly different preferences when it comes to food and lodging overall (eg, some people prefer to splurge on one and skimp on the other) so we just try to pay well and allow people to make their own decisions as to how to spend it.

We&#x27;re looking for intermediate to senior level developers for at least one (or preferably both) of next two positions (and maybe some interns or beginner-level developers immediately after that).<p>---<p>We also work on a lot on open-source.

Our open-source projects have over 8,000 combined stars on Github so far.<p>We also each have our own side-projects we work on as well, including our company status dashboard (built on Node) which pulls from all of our internal applications in real-time to show how we&#x27;re doing that week, an application which helps you record and save your important voicemails forever, and several others.<p>If working on startups and open-source sounds like a lot of fun to you, then you might be a good fit :-) If you&#x27;re ready to become an integral part of a startup building startups, let us know.<p>Check us out (<a href="http://www.alfajango.com" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.alfajango.com</a>), and reach out to us at support@alfajango.com.<p>[1] <a href="https://github.com/rails/jquery-ujs" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;rails&#x2F;jquery-ujs</a><p>[2] <a href="http://rubygems.org/gems/jquery-rails" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;rubygems.org&#x2F;gems&#x2F;jquery-rails</a><p>[3] <a href="https://github.com/kandanapp/kandan" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;kandanapp&#x2F;kandan</a><p>[4] <a href="http://www.dynatable.com/" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.dynatable.com&#x2F;</a><p>[5] <a href="http://os.alfajango.com/" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;os.alfajango.com&#x2F;</a></font></span><p><font size="1"><u><a href="reply?id=8543324&amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%38%35%34%32%38%39%32">reply</a></u></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border="0"><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height="1" width="0"></td><td valign="top"><center><a id="up_8574538" onclick="return vote(this)" href="vote?for=8574538&amp;dir=up&amp;by=jecjec&amp;auth=80f1082f5f2376db7830d1c4467463a933e24da2&amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%38%35%34%32%38%39%32"><div class="votearrow" title="upvote"></div></a><span id="down_8574538"></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=ericbogs">ericbogs</a> 1 day ago  | <a href="item?id=8574538">link</a></span></div><br>

Our first application area is pathogen detection – working with doctors, epidemiologists, and public health officials to identify and characterize the bacteria and viruses that threaten our health. And already, we’ve attracted users at many of the top public health and research organizations across the globe.<p>===============<p>==== About You ====<p>===============<p>We’re looking for talented software engineers to help us build towards our vision for a global genomics data network and enable widespread <i>in</i> <i>silico</i> diagnostics. Specifically, we’re interested in folks with a passion for and depth of experience in one or more of the following areas:<p>1) Full Stack Engineering: We will be building everything from developer-facing APIs to easy-to-use end applications for doctors and public health officials. You care about everything from elegant APIs to compelling data visualizations. Python experience preferred (we currently use Flask for our web backend).<p>2) Distributed Systems: We’re building systems for organizing and indexing billions to trillions of genomic fingerprints across the entire tree of life. You’re passionate about data structures, efficient computational solutions, and distributed systems (and don’t mind the occasional bit twiddling). We’ve built some cool initial tech in C, Nimrod, and Python (probabilistic data structures, Docker pipelines for reliably running bioinformatics workflows, etc.), and are excited about the extensive greenfield opportunities here.<p>3) Genomics &#x2F; Computational Biology: We are tackling hard problems at the intersection of microbiology, genomics, statistics, and computer science. You have research experience or another strong connection to these fields, understand current bioinformatics tools and approaches (and their limits), and have worked extensively with next-generation sequencing data. Ideally, you also have some intuitions and strong hypotheses about how bioinformatics tools can scale for petabyte-sized reference sets.<p>===<p>You’ll be one of our earliest hires and directly shape our technology choices, product, and business.

Interested in changing the world? Neither are we! But we are interested in having fun and building cool software.<p>FlareWorks is a visual messaging startup headquartered in San Francisco, California. Our mission is to build a platform for contextual, visual communication between family and friends that is easier and simpler than Texting. In short - &quot;Kill Text&quot;. Our company’s visual messaging service —called Flares— uses visual cues, instead of text, to provide communication shortcuts between friends and family. We&#x27;re a seed funded, early stage startup, so this is an opportunity to get in on the ground floor. You would be engineer number 3. We&#x27;re looking for Android developers to help us take our mobile application and platform to the next level. Our mobile apps are the face of the organization and, as such, you’ll be on the front lines of creating an application and experience that has the potential to be used by millions of people every day. We&#x27;re currently in the Apple app store and are now looking to expand into Android&#x2F;Google Play. Our app was featured as the &quot;best new app&quot; by Apple the first week it was released and we have consistently received great press for our MVP.<p>Our Stack: 
  * Node for our API.
  * Erlang&#x2F;Elixir for our platform.<p>What we offer:
  * We&#x27;re not fans of 9-5 with a lunch break. Work when you want, where you want. Results matter. &quot;Seat Time&quot; does not. 
  * Unlimited PTO. Take the time off you need, when you need it. We don&#x27;t offer prizes for &#x27;attendance&#x27;. 
  * 5K equipment budget. Buy what you want; After a year with us, it&#x27;s yours to keep. 
  * Company outings. We like to get out and do things as a team. Lunches, dinners, games, volunteering, concerts. We&#x27;re always on the lookout for things to do. 
  * A real voice. We want to know what you think. If you have an idea or think something isn&#x27;t working, we want to hear about it. Your voice counts. 
  * Generous options and an actual competitive salary (no low-balling + options bait and switch here ).<p>What we&#x27;re looking for:
  * Android and iOS engineers. 
  * UX and visual design chops. 
  * Meticulous attention to details. 
  * Android: 
    * Animation and the hardware accelerated rendering pipeline as well as OpenGL ES. 
    * Location, Content and Media SDK experience. 
  * iOS:
    * Core Graphics, Core Animation, Core Data, Core Location
    * Comfort with rapid iteration and real-time team collaboration.
    * Excited about and eager to use Swift.<p>If this sounds like a good fit for you, email us ( jobs@flareworks.co ) and we&#x27;ll talk.</font></span><p><font size="1"><u><a href="reply?id=8543752&amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%38%35%34%32%38%39%32">reply</a></u></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border="0"><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height="1" width="0"></td><td valign="top"><center><a id="up_8543551" onclick="return vote(this)" href="vote?for=8543551&amp;dir=up&amp;by=jecjec&amp;auth=b1f0ee40b4f98f1bad56d701521a99bf289ce460&amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%38%35%34%32%38%39%32"><div class="votearrow" title="upvote"></div></a><span id="down_8543551"></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=fuelfive">fuelfive</a> 8 days ago  | <a href="item?id=8543551">link</a></span></div><br>

The product features real-time, live-updating data and context-dependent interfaces, so you’ll be building a very rich client-side web application.<p>* Backend Engineer - Robinhood is looking for an experienced backend engineer to help build our brokerage web API.

We&#x27;re focused on building a profitable long-term business with a product our customers love.
We can’t compete with Google on start-up perks, but we can more than compete if you’re looking to sink you teeth in and have a major impact:
* Impact: we’re expecting anyone that joins to come in and have a major impact. We’re small enough that every customer interaction, every marketing spend, every line of code has an over-sized impact.
* Equity: we don’t need hired-guns, we need team members. We want to share our long-term vision and success, and make sure you have equity in that journey.
* Autonomy: we don’t look for specific roles, we look for good fits. You’ll be able to contribute with your strengths and determine the projects you want to drive forward.
* Flexibility: supporting our chosen lifestyles is major part of our success equation. Join a remote team and create your own hours. Work how and where you want to.
* Culture: we work hard, but also don’t take ourselves too seriously and make sure we have a great time along the way.</font></span><p><font size="1"><u><a href="reply?id=8555077&amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%38%35%34%32%38%39%32">reply</a></u></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border="0"><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height="1" width="0"></td><td valign="top"><center><a id="up_8546212" onclick="return vote(this)" href="vote?for=8546212&amp;dir=up&amp;by=jecjec&amp;auth=ef170e2523fd454ae69a7b5c854815167a5e0ad4&amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%38%35%34%32%38%39%32"><div class="votearrow" title="upvote"></div></a><span id="down_8546212"></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=tianyicui">tianyicui</a> 7 days ago  | <a href="item?id=8546212">link</a></span></div><br>
<span class="comment"><font color="#000000">Jane Street - New York City, London, Hong Kong - Software Developer (Functinoal Programming)<p>(I personally work at the Hong Kong office. Feel free to get in touch via tcui@janestreet.com if you have any questions.)<p>Jane Street is a technology-focused proprietary trading firm. We are looking to hire great software developers with an interest in functional programming. OCaml, a statically typed functional programming with similarities to Haskell, Erlang, F# and SML, is our language of choice. We’ve got the largest team of OCaml developers in any industrial setting, and probably the world’s largest OCaml codebase. We use OCaml for running our entire business, supporting everything from research to systems administration to trading systems. If you’re interested in seeing how functional programming plays out in the real world, there’s no better place.<p>The atmosphere is informal and intellectual. There is a focus on education, and people learn about software and trading, both through formal classes and on the job. The work is challenging, and you get to see the practical impact of your efforts in quick and dramatic terms. Jane Street is also small enough that people have the freedom to get involved in many different areas of the business. Compensation is highly competitive, and there’s a lot of room for growth.<p>You can learn more about Jane Street and our technology from our main site, janestreet.com. You can also look at a a talk given at CMU about why Jane Street uses functional programming (<a href="http://ocaml.janestreet.com/?q=node/61" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;ocaml.janestreet.com&#x2F;?q=node&#x2F;61</a>) and our programming blog (<a href="http://ocaml.janestreet.com" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;ocaml.janestreet.com</a>)<p>(More in <a href="http://careers.stackoverflow.com/jobs?searchTerm=jane+street" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;careers.stackoverflow.com&#x2F;jobs?searchTerm=jane+street</a> and <a href="https://www.janestreet.com/join-jane-street/" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.janestreet.com&#x2F;join-jane-street&#x2F;</a>)</font></span><p><font size="1"><u><a href="reply?id=8546212&amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%38%35%34%32%38%39%32">reply</a></u></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border="0"><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height="1" width="0"></td><td valign="top"><center><a id="up_8543077" onclick="return vote(this)" href="vote?for=8543077&amp;dir=up&amp;by=jecjec&amp;auth=9e2213565d2781d582d0155063c8ac8f8de929a5&amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%38%35%34%32%38%39%32"><div class="votearrow" title="upvote"></div></a><span id="down_8543077"></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=johnnyg">johnnyg</a> 8 days ago  | <a href="item?id=8543077">link</a></span></div><br>

We currently work with over 160 sports teams and concert venues to bring amazing experiences to fans across the country.  Our passion is building fantastic (and award winning<i></i>) products that both fans and teams love.<p>We have some big and interesting technical problems in front of us. How do you determine the market price for an upgrade such that you maximize both the number of fans moved and the revenue generated per game?  How do you predict who will and will not attend the game and allow for fluid seating at an event?<p>Some technologies we use: Groovy&#x2F;Grails, PostgreSql, Redis, BackboneJS, etc. Experience with any of these is not required. We believe a good dev can pick up tools as necessary. We move fast, and we love new challenges and finding the right solution for them.

Our first sensor network is for wireless signal [1] where we are building a global database on the coverage and performance of wireless networks (both mobile + WiFi) on a scale that has never before been possible. Our second sensor network is WeatherSignal [2], which uses the barometers, thermometers and hygrometers on smart phones to crowdsource weather data and we have already published a scientific paper [3] showing the potential of this approach. If the concept of crowdsourced sensor networks appeals to you too then please get in touch.

We&#x27;re self-funded and profitable. We&#x27;re looking to add more engineers to our team. We do a wide variety of things so a generalist is more likely to succeed than a specialist. Rather than list specific requirements, I&#x27;ll just list the areas of experience and technologies we currently utilize on a daily basis.<p>* PHP - 5.5, modern code-base, back-end development, daemon processes, distributed workers<p>* MySQL - Medium-to-advanced SQL techniques, proper normalization, tuning configuration for efficiency. We work with PostgreSQL as well.<p>* Data-warehousing Understanding large datastores, star-schemas, fact-dimensions, pros&#x2F;cons of a RDBMS versus a document-storage engine, Hadoop, columnar databases, etc -- all good things to know.<p>* Redis - Acts as a job broker &amp; message queue for our platform<p>* AWS - We utilize a number of AWS services (ec2, route 53, s3, rds, vpc, etc)<p>* Web&#x2F;Mobile - We really dig into how the web and APIs (soap, xml, rest, json, etc) operate on a technical level. Mobile data is just as important. Understanding the role and specifics around things like: http, ssl&#x2F;tls, iphone, android, mitm, reverse-engineering are all important.<p>* Excel - The investment world loves Microsoft Excel and having a very solid understanding of XLSX, auto-generation of spreadsheets, dynamic data-source integrations is important.<p>* Automation&#x2F;testing We run a 24x7 platform and need to be confident things are running smoothly at all times.<p>I understand this is quite a laundry-list of technical skills, and so if you feel you&#x27;re strong in a few or more of these areas, we&#x27;d love to talk to you. We provide a competitive salary and benefits. We&#x27;re a small company and starting our physical footprint here in Portland (we&#x27;ve been 100% remote for the past three years) so we can collaborate better.<p>tim@savvr.com</font></span><p><font size="1"><u><a href="reply?id=8544314&amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%38%35%34%32%38%39%32">reply</a></u></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border="0"><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height="1" width="0"></td><td valign="top"><center><a id="up_8547601" onclick="return vote(this)" href="vote?for=8547601&amp;dir=up&amp;by=jecjec&amp;auth=32052e38e0ed7553103f4a5193332a84b050d99a&amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%38%35%34%32%38%39%32"><div class="votearrow" title="upvote"></div></a><span id="down_8547601"></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=xiongww"><font color="#3c963c">xiongww</font></a> 6 days ago  | <a href="item?id=8547601">link</a></span></div><br>

We&#x27;re building one of the most important apps on mobile, an urban transport app built on the back of open data, to help navigate and use cities. We&#x27;re a VC-backed startup (Balderton, Index, Greylock, Connect) based in London with a team with backgrounds from Google, academia and startups.
We&#x27;re looking for great people first and foremost, but especially the following roles:
- Routing. We&#x27;re reinventing getting from A to B in the world of mobile, multi modal and real-time data.
- Infrastructure engineer. Be responsible for our platform in the cloud, shape the tool chain, and ensure that the moving parts of our system can communicate, so that we can expand to all the cities in the world.
- Android and iOS developers. We&#x27;re reimagining mobile interfaces and developing all the features that we dream about. You care about the &quot;little big details&quot; and know the grotty implementation details required to make things work across a range of devices and future platforms.
- Data pipeline&#x2F;data science&#x2F;analytics. We&#x27;re building an omnivorous transport data processor that fuses together loads of data sources, and a psychic city brain.
- Software engineers. We&#x27;re looking for great engineers to solve a range of other big problems, including search, data analysis, natural language processing. We use a lot of Python, and some C and Java.

We are looking for a talented and experienced engineer to join our founding engineering team. Our founders were key executives at Quidsi, the ecommerce company behind Diapers.com that was acquired by Amazon for $545M. Our Creative Director has launched several successful online brands and I was most recently CTO at Lot18 where I lead the engineering team behind Lot18.com and later launched TastingRoom.com, the first technology enabled personalized wine club. TastingRoom went from 0-10M$&#x2F;yr in less than a year and was built from scratch using Flask.<p>At Primary, we&#x27;re building our website using Spree&#x27;s Ruby On Rails ecommerce framework. I&#x27;m loving the framework so far and our stack is going to be really fun to work with. As we grow, I&#x27;d like us to be polyglot but for now this is awesome. We&#x27;re not just building another ecommerce website with better design, we&#x27;re going to rethink every aspect of how a company in our space operates and think smart, simple with technology at the heart of everything we do.<p>I&#x27;d love to hire someone who loves working on frontend technology but would obviously also be happy with a more fullstack engineer. I don&#x27;t believe in putting people in a box (frontend&#x2F;backend&#x2F;etc).  Right now, I am mostly focused on hiring someone awesome who can be a good foundation for the kind of team I want to build. You would be on the founding engineering team and work closely with a really smart and friendly team. We are going to build something big here.<p>Some of the things I love about this company are that we value design, we&#x27;re scrappy even though we raised a significant seed round from top seed level investors and we have well defined values as a team.<p>Say hi - I&#x27;m the CTO email me at arach@primary.com</font></span><p><font size="1"><u><a href="reply?id=8543641&amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%38%35%34%32%38%39%32">reply</a></u></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border="0"><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height="1" width="0"></td><td valign="top"><center><a id="up_8545979" onclick="return vote(this)" href="vote?for=8545979&amp;dir=up&amp;by=jecjec&amp;auth=a9532ec176948c748808f98efc74ad2bf0ce7936&amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%38%35%34%32%38%39%32"><div class="votearrow" title="upvote"></div></a><span id="down_8545979"></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=antoviaque">antoviaque</a> 7 days ago  | <a href="item?id=8545979">link</a></span></div><br>

If you love designing and building modern, responsive web applications that make it easy for business users to run sophisticated investment analysis software, we would like to talk to you. We’re an established company with actual paying customers and we want to make our little corner of the world a better place for our users.<p>We use standards-based HTML, JavaScript and CSS, along with state of the art technologies – Canvas, SVG, RequireJS, Backbone, Marionette, and LESS – to build cross-browser interfaces and advanced data visualizations. The backend is a mixture of C#, Java, C++ because we believe in using the right tool for the job, and we are regularly evaluating our tools to ensure that. Our development process is agile and we release our web products approximately once a month.<p>Our offices are a five minute walk from the Nevada shore of Lake Tahoe and Heavenly ski resort is a fifteen minute drive from the office. As a developer you’ll also get your own private office and even though we mostly develop on Windows, all our developers have Mac hardware. We prefer to hire generalists who are as curious and excited about technology as we are. All of us enjoy learning new technologies and tools; we have a small team and each developer should be able to work on every aspect of the system.<p>To get a feel for one of our software products, please visit zephyrondemand.com and click Try Zephyr Analytics.<p>Please note: this is a full-time position in our Zephyr Cove office. Remote work will be considered based on experience, but total travel time to the Zephyr office can be no longer than 3 hours.

<span class="comment"><font color="#000000">Rentify | London | Visa possible<p>Rentify is always hiring talented software engineers to join our team.<p>We&#x27;re c. 50 people based across two sites in the UK, and we believe that estate agents don&#x27;t have a right to exist in 2014. We also believe fees should be lower for landlords and tenants alike, and that technology should improve the lives of everyone in the rental sector.<p>So far we&#x27;ve transacted with over 160,000 landlords and just over a million tenants.<p>We are a Rails shop and we believe in TDD + the best solution winning the day, rather than the loudest voice. We favour engineers who focus on shipping and who have a track record of simplifying, cutting corners, and knowing when it&#x27;s a good thing to accrue some technical debt.<p>Our office in London is right next door to Barbican tube station. It&#x27;s dual facing so there&#x27;s lots of natural sunlight, and we have a bar, soft drinks and snacks, a bunch of breakout spaces, video games, and all that sort of thing. We pay market + stock options, and have a strong culture, which I&#x27;d broadly characterise as hard-working, fun, and informal.<p>We&#x27;re recruiting for all experience levels: some combination of Ruby, Rails, and JavaScript is required, but mainly we want a strong work ethic and a winning personality. We&#x27;re especially keen to hear from women who are in the junior - midweight bracket.<p>If you&#x27;ve had a bad experience using an estate agent, then come and help us create a future without them.

<span class="comment"><font color="#000000">Blend Labs | <a href="https://blendlabs.com/" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blendlabs.com&#x2F;</a> | San Francisco | Software Engineer<p>The last 10 years saw a massive boom in the US real estate market fueled by troubled loans buyers couldn’t afford. An even larger, chaotic bust followed, with losses of $2.8 trillion, along with the homes of more than 14 million Americans. While the economy has since improved, many processes within the mortgage industry have not. Gains have been made primarily in paperwork and manpower, not technology. Operations remain manual and slow and consumers are not happy.<p>At Blend, we&#x27;re fixing these problems by replacing the archaic software and manual processes currently used for home lending.

Using google doc, sms or even email is strictly illegal because those tools aren’t built with patient security in mind. On top of being highly inefficient, managing critical information in a high-speed environment using paper literally kills patients. (400 000 patients <i>every year</i>, just in the US, die from miscommunication errors between doctors).<p>That’s why we built Listrunner: We bring project management from the modern world into a beautiful HIPAA compliant app. Think Asana for doctors.<p>About you:<p><pre><code>  - You have a few iOS apps under your belt.
  - You have an eye for design and want to create a delightful experience.
  - You can jump in and help crafting html, css and javascript.
  - You’re a team player with startup experience.

<span class="comment"><font color="#9c9c9c">NOT A COMPANY OR A JOB BOARD, <i>Just a relevant piece of information</i><p>To job seekers, Andy Rachleff (Benchmark), Dustin Moskovitz (Facebook&#x2F;Asana), and Sheryl Sandberg (Facebook) suggest choosing a company on a breakout trajectory. [My addition: whose mission &amp; team you strongly align with. [1]]<p><pre><code>  If you join a company, my general advice is to join a company on a breakout trajectory. There are a usually a handful of these at a time, and they are usually identifiable to a smart young person. They are a very good risk&#x2F;reward tradeoff. Such a company is almost certainly going to be successful, but the rest of the world isn’t quite as convinced of it as they should be.
