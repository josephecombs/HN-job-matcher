Hi everyone.  I used the Nokogiri gem to parse the HN jobs threads this month, then I used the similar_text gem to create a ranking of jobs to apply to for each user who posted.

If you posted to the "seeking a job" thread, you can look in /spit to see the ranking of jobs you should apply to based on .levenshtein_similar method's (of the amatch gem) comparison of your post to each of the "seeking" posts.

PS - hire me!  I posted as jecjec in the hiring thread!
