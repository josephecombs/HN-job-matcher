Hi everyone.  I want to use Nokogiri to parse the Hacker News jobs thread.  Next I want to match job seekers and companies who are hiring.

If you posted to the "seeking" thread, you can look in /spit to see the ranking of jobs you should apply to based on .similar method's (of the similar_text gem) comparison of your post to each of the "seeking" posts.

PS - plz hire me!  I posted as jecjec int the thread!
